The Object Descriptor String is an element of a baryon that describes the layout
of the semantic content of the baryon's inner layer.  Its purpose is to enable
implementations to have some basic understanding of the contents of the object
so that operations can be performed on those contents even without having full
capability to process them, in cases where that may be a useful thing to do.

An Object Descriptor String consists of a series of variable-length sequences of
digits and alphanumeric characters.  Each entry in the series represents one of
the fields in the baryon's inner layer, and is constructed as follows:
    * The length in bits of the field, represented as a decimal number
    * A field type identifier (see below), two characters long
    * The length in characters of the field name
    * The field name

Field type identifiers are as possible, and provide information about the data
type:
    * "ui" - an unsigned integer
    * "si" - a signed integer
    * "ch" - a character type
    * "st" - a string type
    * "fp" - a floating point type

For example, the following C field definition:

    uint16_t ExampleField;

would be represented with the following ODS:

    "16ui12ExampleField"

Note that the length of the field name does not include any null terminator.

There are no separators between entries in the object descriptor string.
