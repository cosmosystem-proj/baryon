A baryon consists of two layers:
    * An outer layer of metadata
    * An inner layer which is the actual semantic contents of the object

The inner layer is addressed by reference rather than being directly part of the
top-level baryon object.

The metadata includes:
    * A 64-bit version field.  The only reason the version field is 64 bits is
      because every other member of the field is 64 bits or a multiple thereof,
      so for alignment purposes it's going to be padded to 64 bits/8 bytes
      anyway.  At present, 1 is the only recognized version number.
    * An ID (256-bit) to uniquely identify the baryon internally.  This ID is
      unique to the instance of the baryon, and is represented internally as an
      array of four sequential 64-bit unsigned integers.
    * A reference to the inner layer.  The exact form this takes varies based on
      environment; it could be a pointer, a numerical identifier, or the direct
      nesting of the inner layer.

The full layout of the inner layer is of course content-dependent, but it begins
with the following common initial elements, always of the specified size and in
the specified order, so that implementations can obtain the information they
need to process the remainder:
    * A 256-bit type ID, represented as an array of four sequential 64-bit
      unsigned integers.
    * A 64-bit type version number, defined separately for each distinct type.
    * A 64-bit length field, specifying the size (in bytes) of the entire inner
      layer, including these common initial elements.
    * A 64-bit string length field, specifying the size (in bytes) of the
      subsequent Object Descriptor String.
    * The Object Descriptor String, a null-terminated string of bytes describing
      the remainder of the fields in the inner-layer object.  See ods.txt for a
      full explanation.
