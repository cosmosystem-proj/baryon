A baryon consists of two layers:
    * An outer layer of metadata
    * An inner layer which is the actual semantic contents of the object

The inner layer is addressed by reference rather than being directly part of the top-level baryon object.

The metadata includes:
    * A 64-bit version field.  The only reason the version field is 64 bits is
    because every other member of the field is 64 bits or a multiple thereof, so
    for alignment purposes it's going to be padded to 64 bits/8 bytes anyway.
    * An ID (256-bit) to uniquely identify the baryon internally.  This ID is
    unique to the instance of the baryon, and is represented internally as an
    array of four sequential 64-bit unsigned integers.
